CONDITION AND LOOPS ASSIGNMENT
-------------------------------

Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples ?

Ans. Conditional statements are used make correct decisions based on the coditions. These execute different codes as the situation provided to them changes.
     These basically work on boolean values that is true and false. Conditional makes the website dynamic as it executes code based on the user interactions.
     Some of the conditional statements are : - 

     =>     (condition)?(example-1):(example-2)

     =>     if(condition){
                // example-1
            }

     =>     if(condition){
                // example-1
            }else{
                // example-2   
            }

     =>     if(condition){
                // example-1
            }else{
                if(condition-2){
                    example-2
                }else{
                    example-3
                }
                
            }

    In all these, there are conditions given all the decision of conditional statement is depend on that condition such that if the condition is true, the 
    conditional statement execute example-1 and if condition is false, it execute example-2

    Example ->
    ----------

            let num = 1;
            if(num==1){
                console.log("One");
            }else{
                console.log("Not One");
            }

Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans. Loops are used in js in order to repeatedly run a block of code until a specific condition doesn't become false.
     These are specifically needed to do repetitive task on collections of data.
    There are basically 3 types of loops - for loop, while loop and do while loop.
     
     => For Loop - 
            Syntax - 
                for(initial expression; condition; update expression){
                    // loop body
                } 

            Here after running initial expression it checks condition to be true and runs loop body and updates expression and check backs condition to be true 
            and runs body this process continue till condition become false.

            Example - 

                for(let i=1;i<=10;i++){
                    console.log(i);
                }

     => While Loop - 
            Syntax - 
                while(condition){
                    //while body 
                }

            Here the while body runs until the condition given in while becomes false.

            Example - 

                let num = 1;
                while(num<=10){
                    console.log(num);
                }

     => Do While Loop - 
            Syntax - 
                do{
                    //loop body
                }while(condition);

            It's the same as while loop but runs one time more whether the condition is true or false.
